          36% plan to spend their holidays in their home country. Like, why are we here, at home,
          did not see? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with an affectionate
          the sea of the south, the dense forests of the Sayans and the harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau. And also
          you can see all these beauties without millions in the account, a passport and
          multi-hour flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova is a brave young
          mother, who took in an armful of three children, seated them in her "Lada" and
          traveled 20 thousand kilometers in his native country. We have selected and described
          some interesting places worthy of your vacation.

              Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of all due to
              mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see slopes strewn
              pines, mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open in the car
              windows, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places -
              mountain air.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">
              The climate in Altai is temperate, so it is best to go here in summer.
              So you will see all the variety of local flora and fauna. Through the woods
              Elks roam Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and graze on the plains
              roe deer. And the famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.

              Everyone knows Baikal as the largest lake in the world. Many also
              know that this is the largest source of fresh water and one of
              most beautiful places in Russia.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">
              Of course, it's all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place
              for skijoring competitions. This is such a sport when a skier
              ties himself to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much as possible
              more speed on ice. In March 2019 at the festival
              "Baikal Mile" was set a world record - 197.011 km / h.
